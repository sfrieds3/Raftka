# Raftka

**Not intended for production use**

This is an implementation of Raft in Scala using Akka (that is *very much* a work in
progress). I named it Raftka, because I thought it should have a cool name.

I tried to keep this as faithful as possible to the paper's implementation, but
there is still a lot of room for improvement.
